Hello, I'm Adhish, and I have experience building web apps using the MERN Javascript Stack: ReactJS, MongoDB, ExpressJS and NodeJS. I am also interested in data engineering using SQL and am learning PySpark. I have some experience developing machine learning models, performing visualizations using Python, and have used BeautifulSoup and Selenium libraries for web scraping as well as nltk libraries for sentiment analysis using natural language processing. I also am an AWS Certified Cloud practitioner and am interested in exploring cloud technologies further.
